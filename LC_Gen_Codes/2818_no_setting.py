Here is the implementation of the `maximumScore` function:


class Solution:
    def maximumScore(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def get_prime_factors(num):
            factors = set()
            while num % 2 == 0:
                factors.add(2)
                num //= 2
            for i in range(3, int(num ** 0.5) + 1, 2):
                while num % i == 0:
                    factors.add(i)
                    num //= i
            if num > 2:
                factors.add(num)
            return factors

        left = right = k
        score = 1
        while left >= 0 and right < len(nums):
            subarray = nums[left:right+1]
            max_score = -1
            max_index = -1
            for i in range(len(subarray)):
                prime_score = len(get_prime_factors(subarray[i]))
                if prime_score > max_score or (prime_score == max_score and i < max_index):
                    max_score = prime_score
                    max_index = i
            score *= subarray[max_index]
            left -= max_index
            right += len(subarray) - max_index - 1
        return score % (10**9 + 7)


Explanation:
1. The `get_prime_factors` function is used to find all the distinct prime factors of a number.
2. The variables `left` and `right` are initialized to `k`, representing the left and right indices of the subarray.
3. The variable `score` is initialized to 1, which is the initial score.
4. The main loop runs while `left` is greater than or equal to 0 and `right` is less than the length of `nums`.
5. In each iteration, the current subarray is taken as `nums[left:right+1]`.
6. The maximum prime score among the elements in the subarray is found by iterating over the subarray and calculating the prime score for each element.
7. If multiple elements have the same maximum prime score, the one with the smallest index is chosen.
8. The score is then multiplied by the chosen element.
9. The `left` and `right` indices are updated based on the chosen element's index and the length of the subarray.
10. Finally, the result is returned as `score % (10**9 + 7)` to account for the modulo requirement.
