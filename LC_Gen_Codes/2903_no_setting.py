Here's the implementation of the `findIndices` function to solve the problem:


from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findIndices(self, nums: List[int], indexDifference: int, valueDifference: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if abs(i - j) >= indexDifference and abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference:
                    return [i, j]
        return [-1, -1]


The function `findIndices` takes three parameters: `nums` (the input integer array), `indexDifference`, and `valueDifference`. It returns a list of two integers representing the indices (i, j) that satisfy the given conditions.

The function uses a nested loop to iterate over all possible pairs of indices i and j. It checks if the absolute difference between i and j is greater than or equal to `indexDifference` and if the absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is greater than or equal to `valueDifference`. If such a pair is found, it is returned as the answer. Otherwise, if no such pair is found after checking all possible pairs, it returns [-1, -1] indicating that it is impossible to find such indices.
