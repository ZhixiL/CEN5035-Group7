Here is the complete implementation of the Solution class:


class Solution:
    def maximumBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        beauties = {}
        max_beauty = 0
        
        # Calculate the beauty for each number in the array
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] not in beauties:
                beauties[nums[i]] = 0
            beauties[nums[i]] += 1
        
        # Check if any number can be replaced and increase the beauty
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if beauties[nums[i]] < 2:
                continue
            beauty = beauties[nums[i]] * 2
            if nums[i] - k <= nums[i] + k:
                beauty -= 1
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, beauty)
        
        return max_beauty


The code first creates a dictionary `beauties` to store the frequency of each number in the array. Then, it calculates the initial beauty for each number in the array based on its frequency.

Next, it checks if any number can be replaced and increases the beauty accordingly. It checks if the number's range [nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k] is valid, and if so, it subtracts 1 from the beauty since one element will be replaced.

Finally, it returns the maximum beauty achieved after applying the operations.
