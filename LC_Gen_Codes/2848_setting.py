The code can be implemented by iterating through each car's starting and ending points and counting the number of integer points between them (inclusive). We can use a set to keep track of all the points that are covered by any car.

Here's the implementation of the `numberOfPoints` function:


class Solution:
    def numberOfPoints(self, nums: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        covered_points = set()
        
        for car in nums:
            start = car[0]
            end = car[1]
            
            for point in range(start, end+1):
                covered_points.add(point)
        
        return len(covered_points)


The function takes in a `nums` parameter, which is a list of lists representing the starting and ending points of cars. It initializes an empty set called `covered_points` to keep track of the covered points.

Then, it iterates through each car in the `nums` list. For each car, it extracts the starting and ending points. It then iterates through all the points between the starting and ending points (inclusive) and adds them to the `covered_points` set.

Finally, it returns the length of the `covered_points` set, which represents the count of unique covered points.

Note: The code assumes that the `List` class is imported from the `typing` module.
