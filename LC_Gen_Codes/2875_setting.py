# Explanation:
# - We initialize the prefix_sum to 0, which will keep track of the cumulative sum of the elements.
# - We also initialize min_len to float('inf') which will keep track of the shortest subarray length.
# - We initialize the start pointer to 0, which will keep track of the start index of the subarray.
# - We iterate through the nums array using a for loop.
# - In each iteration, we update the prefix_sum by adding the current element.
# - If the prefix_sum is greater than or equal to the target, it means we have found a subarray with the desired sum.
# - We update the min_len by taking the minimum of its current value and the length of the subarray (i - start + 1).
# - We then move the start pointer to the next index and subtract the corresponding element from the prefix_sum.
# - We continue to move the start pointer until the prefix_sum is less than the target.
# - Finally, if the min_len is still set to float('inf'), it means we haven't found any subarray with the desired sum and we return -1.
# - Otherwise, we return the min_len, which represents the shortest subarray length.
