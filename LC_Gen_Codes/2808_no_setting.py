Here's one possible implementation of the `minimumSeconds` method in Python:


from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minimumSeconds(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        min_val = min(nums)
        max_val = max(nums)
        
        if min_val == max_val:
            return 0
        
        min_seconds = float("inf")
        for target in range(min_val, max_val+1):
            seconds = 0
            for i in range(n):
                diff = abs(nums[i] - target)
                seconds += min(diff, n - diff)
            min_seconds = min(min_seconds, seconds)
        
        return min_seconds


The `minimumSeconds` method takes in the input `nums`, which is a list of integers. It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min` and `max` functions.

If the minimum and maximum values are equal, it means that all elements in the initial array are the same and we don't need to perform any operations. In this case, the method returns 0.

Otherwise, it initializes `min_seconds` to a large value (`float("inf")`). Then, it iterates over each possible target value (from `min_val` to `max_val`). For each target value, it calculates the number of seconds required to equalize the array by comparing each element with the target value, taking into account the circular nature of the array.

The method updates `min_seconds` with the minimum value found so far. Finally, it returns the minimum number of seconds needed to equalize the array.

Note that the implementation uses the `abs` function to calculate the absolute difference between two values and the `min` function to choose the smaller of two values.
