Here is the code implementation for the given problem:


class Solution:
    def countSymmetricIntegers(self, low: int, high: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(low, high+1):
            num_str = str(i)
            
            # Numbers with an odd number of digits are never symmetric
            if len(num_str) % 2 != 0:
                continue
            
            n = len(num_str) // 2
            
            # Check if the sum of the first n digits is equal to the sum of the last n digits
            if sum(map(int, num_str[:n])) == sum(map(int, num_str[n:])):
                count += 1
        
        return count


The function `countSymmetricIntegers` takes in two parameters, `low` and `high`, representing the range of numbers to check for symmetric integers. It initializes a variable `count` to keep track of the number of symmetric integers.

The function then iterates over the range of numbers from `low` to `high+1`. For each number, it converts it to a string `num_str`.

If the length of `num_str` is odd, indicating that the number has an odd number of digits, it skips to the next iteration using the `continue` statement.

If the length of `num_str` is even, it calculates the midpoint `n` by dividing the length of `num_str` by 2.

It then checks if the sum of the first `n` digits, obtained by slicing `num_str` from index 0 to `n`, is equal to the sum of the last `n` digits, obtained by slicing `num_str` from index `n` to the end.

If the sum of the first `n` digits is equal to the sum of the last `n` digits, it increments the `count` variable by 1.

Finally, the function returns the `count`, which represents the number of symmetric integers in the given range.
