Here's one possible implementation of the minimumSum() function in Python:


class Solution:
    def minimumSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        min_sum = float('inf')  # initialize the minimum sum to positive infinity
        
        for j in range(1, n-1):  # iterate through the middle element of the potential mountain triplets
            left = max(nums[:j])  # left element is the maximum element before the middle element
            right = max(nums[j+1:])  # right element is the maximum element after the middle element
            
            if nums[j] > left and nums[j] > right:  # check if the middle element is greater than the left and right elements
                min_sum = min(min_sum, nums[j] + left + right)  # update the minimum sum if necessary
        
        if min_sum == float('inf'):  # if no mountain triplet is found, return -1
            return -1
        
        return min_sum  # return the minimum sum of the mountain triplet


This implementation finds the middle element of the potential mountain triplets and checks if it is greater than both the maximum element on its left and the maximum element on its right. If it is, the sum of the three elements is calculated and the minimum sum is updated if necessary. After iterating through all the middle elements, the minimum sum is returned. If no mountain triplet is found, -1 is returned.
