Here's the complete implementation of the "sumIndicesWithKSetBits" function in Python:


class Solution:
    def sumIndicesWithKSetBits(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        sum = 0
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            # Count the number of set bits in the binary representation of indices
            count = bin(i).count("1")
            
            # Check if the count is equal to k
            if count == k:
                sum += nums[i]
        
        return sum


This function iterates through the indices of the `nums` list. For each index, it counts the number of set bits in its binary representation using the `bin` function and the `count` method. If the count is equal to `k`, it adds the corresponding element from `nums` to the `sum` variable.

Finally, it returns the `sum` variable as the result.
