Here is the implementation of the maxSum function:


class Solution:
    def maxSum(self, nums):
        max_sum = -1
        digit_max = [0] * 10
        
        for num in nums:
            max_digit = max(str(num))
            digit_max[int(max_digit)] = max(digit_max[int(max_digit)], num)
        
        for i in range(1, 10):
            if digit_max[i] != 0:
                for j in range(i):
                    if digit_max[j] != 0:
                        max_sum = max(max_sum, digit_max[i] + digit_max[j])
        
        return max_sum


Explanation:
- We initialize the max_sum variable as -1, which will store the maximum sum of a pair satisfying the condition.
- We also initialize the digit_max list with 10 elements, each representing the maximum number found so far with a particular digit.
- Then, we iterate through each number in the input array `nums`.
- For each number, we find the maximum digit using the `max()` function and convert it to an integer.
- We update the `digit_max` list at the index corresponding to the maximum digit if the number is greater than the current maximum for that digit.
- After processing all numbers, we iterate through the `digit_max` list, considering only the non-zero elements.
- For each non-zero element, we iterate through the lower digits (0 to i-1) and check if there is a non-zero element at that index.
- If both conditions are satisfied, we update the `max_sum` if the sum of the two elements is greater than the current `max_sum`.
- Finally, we return the `max_sum` as the result.

Note: The code provided assumes that the `Solution` class is already imported and the function is called using an object of that class.
