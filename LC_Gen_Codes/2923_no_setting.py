Here is the implementation of the `findChampion` function in Python:


class Solution:
    def findChampion(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(grid)
        
        # Check each team for being stronger than all other teams
        for i in range(n):
            is_champion = True
            for j in range(n):
                if i != j and grid[i][j] == 1:
                    is_champion = False
                    break
            if is_champion:
                return i
        
        return -1  # No champion found


The function iterates through each team (i) and checks if it is stronger than all other teams by iterating through each other team (j). If a team i is found that is stronger than any other team, it is not considered as the champion. If no team is found to be stronger than team i, it is considered as the champion and its index is returned. If no champion is found, the function returns -1.
