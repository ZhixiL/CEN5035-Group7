Here is the code for the Solution class that implements the numberOfWays function:


class Solution:
    def numberOfWays(self, s: str, t: str, k: int) -> int:
        if s == t:
            return 2 if k > 1 else 1
        
        n = len(s)
        count = 0
        
        # Count the number of matching suffixes
        for i in range(1, n):
            suffix_length = n - i
            if s[i:] + s[:i] == t[:suffix_length]:
                count += 1
        
        # Calculate the number of ways in k operations
        if k == 1:
            return count
        
        # Calculate the number of ways using dynamic programming
        dp = [[0] * (k+1) for _ in range(n)]
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Base cases
        dp[0][1] = 1
        dp[1][1] = count
        
        # Dynamic programming
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i][1] = (dp[i-1][1] * count) % MOD
        
        for j in range(2, k+1):
            dp[0][j] = dp[n-1][j-1]
            dp[1][j] = (dp[n-1][j-1] + (count * dp[1][j-1]) % MOD) % MOD
            
            for i in range(2, n):
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j] + (count * dp[i][j-1]) % MOD) % MOD
        
        return dp[n-1][k] % MOD


This code first checks if the strings s and t are identical. If they are, the number of ways to transform s into t in k operations is 2 if k is greater than 1, and 1 otherwise.

Next, the code iterates through the suffixes of s and checks if they match the prefix of t. It keeps a count of the number of matching suffixes.

Then, the code calculates the number of ways to transform s into t in exactly k operations using dynamic programming. It uses a 2D array `dp` to store the intermediate results. The base cases are initialized, and then the dynamic programming loop calculates the number of ways based on the previous results.

Finally, the result is returned modulo 10^9 + 7.

Note: The code assumes that k is within the range of an integer and does not handle cases where k is larger than that.
