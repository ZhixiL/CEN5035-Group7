Here is the implementation of the isAcronym function.


class Solution:
    def isAcronym(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> bool:
        acronym = ""
        for word in words:
            acronym += word[0]
        return acronym == s


The function iterates through each word in the array `words` and concatenates the first character of each word to form the `acronym` string. Finally, it checks if the `acronym` string is equal to the input `s` and returns the result.
