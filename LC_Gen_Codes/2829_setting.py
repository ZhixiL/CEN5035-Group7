Here is the implementation of the `minimumSum` function:


class Solution:
    def minimumSum(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        return sum(range(1, n+1)) + k*n


Explanation:
- We are given that the array should have a length of `n`. The numbers in the array start from 1 and go up to `n` (inclusive).
- To minimize the sum of the array, we can choose the first `n` consecutive integers from 1 to `n`.
- Additionally, since we want to avoid pairs that sum up to `k`, we can add `k` to every element of the array.
- So, the minimum possible sum of the k-avoiding array is the sum of the first `n` consecutive integers plus `k*n`.
- We can use the formula `(n*(n+1)) // 2` to calculate the sum of the first `n` consecutive integers.
- Therefore, the implementation returns `sum(range(1, n+1)) + k*n`.
