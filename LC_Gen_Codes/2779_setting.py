Here is the implementation of the maximumBeauty function:


class Solution:
    def maximumBeauty(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        max_beauty = 0
        used = set()
        
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] in used:
                continue
            
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, nums.count(nums[i]) + 2 * k)
            used.add(nums[i])
        
        return max_beauty


Explanation:
- We initialize a variable `max_beauty` to store the maximum possible beauty of the array.
- We also initialize a set `used` to keep track of the numbers we have already processed to avoid duplicates.
- We iterate through the array `nums` using a for loop.
- For each element `nums[i]`, we check if it has already been used. If yes, we continue to the next element.
- Inside the loop, we calculate the beauty of `nums` considering `nums[i]` as the target number. The beauty is equal to the count of `nums[i]` in the array plus 2 times `k`.
- We update `max_beauty` with the maximum value between the current `max_beauty` and the calculated beauty.
- Finally, we return `max_beauty` as the maximum possible beauty of the array.
