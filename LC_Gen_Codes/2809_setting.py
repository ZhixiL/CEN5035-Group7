Here is the complete implementation of the `minimumTime` function in Python:


class Solution:
    def minimumTime(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int], x: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums1)
        max_moves = -1
        total_sum = sum(nums1)
        
        if total_sum <= x:
            return 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if nums2[i] == 0:
                continue
            
            # Check if current index can be made 0 in less moves than current max_moves
            if nums1[i] <= (x - total_sum) / nums2[i]:
                max_moves = max(max_moves, nums1[i])
        
        if max_moves == -1:
            return -1
        
        time = 0
        curr_sum = total_sum
        
        for i in range(n):
            if nums1[i] <= max_moves:
                continue
            
            moves_needed = (nums1[i] - max_moves + nums2[i] - 1) // nums2[i]
            
            # If applying operation on this index makes the sum less than or equal to x, return the time
            if curr_sum - moves_needed * max_moves <= x:
                return time + moves_needed
            
            time += moves_needed
            curr_sum -= moves_needed * max_moves
        
        return -1


Explanation:

1. We start by initializing `max_moves` to -1, since we haven't found any index can be made 0 in less moves yet.
2. We calculate the `total_sum` of all elements in `nums1`. If `total_sum` is already less than or equal to `x`, we can return 0.
3. We loop through each index `i` in `nums1` and check if `nums2[i]` is 0. If it is, we skip to the next iteration.
4. For each non-zero `nums2[i]`, we check if the current index `i` can be made 0 in less moves than the current `max_moves`. If it can be, we update `max_moves` accordingly.
5. If no index can be made 0 in less moves, we return -1 as it is not possible to make the sum of nums1 less than or equal to `x`.
6. If we have found a `max_moves`, we initialize `time` and `curr_sum` variables to keep track of the current time and sum respectively.
7. We loop through each index `i` in `nums1` again and check if `nums1[i]` is already less than or equal to `max_moves`. If it is, we skip to the next iteration.
8. For each index where `nums1[i]` is greater than `max_moves`, we calculate the number of moves needed to make it equal to `max_moves`. We use the formula `(nums1[i] - max_moves + nums2[i] - 1) // nums2[i]` to round up the division result.
9. If applying the operation on this index makes the sum less than or equal to `x`, we return the total time by adding `time` and `moves_needed`.
10. If the sum is still greater than `x`, we update the `time` by adding `moves_needed` and `curr_sum` by subtracting `moves_needed * max_moves`.
11. If we have gone through all the indices and have not returned a result yet, it means it is not possible to make the sum of nums1 less than or equal to `x`. In this case, we return -1.
