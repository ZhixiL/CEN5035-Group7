Here is the completed implementation of the `maximizeTheProfit` function:


from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maximizeTheProfit(self, n: int, offers: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total_gold = 0
        
        # Sort the offers by the amount of gold in descending order
        offers.sort(key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
        
        # Create a boolean array to keep track of which houses are sold
        sold_houses = [False] * n
        
        # Iterate through the offers
        for offer in offers:
            start = offer[0]
            end = offer[1]
            gold = offer[2]
            
            # Check if all houses in the offer range are available
            if all(not sold_houses[i] for i in range(start, end+1)):
                # Sell the houses and add the gold to the total
                for i in range(start, end+1):
                    sold_houses[i] = True
                total_gold += gold
        
        return total_gold


You can use this `Solution` class and call the `maximizeTheProfit` function to calculate the maximum amount of gold you can earn.
