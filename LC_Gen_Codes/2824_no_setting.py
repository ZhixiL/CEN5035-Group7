Here is the implementation of the `countPairs` function in Python:


class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if nums[i] + nums[j] < target:
                    count += 1
        
        return count


Note that I have assumed that `List` is imported from `typing` module. The function takes an input array `nums` and an integer `target` and returns the number of pairs of indices (`i`, `j`) where `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`. It uses nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of indices and checks if the sum of their corresponding array elements is less than the target. If it is, the count is incremented. Finally, the count is returned as the result.

Please let me know if you need any further explanation.
