A possible solution that performs the task efficiently would be using list comprehension:


class Solution:
    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(self, hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        return sum(1 for h in hours if h >= target)


This solution uses the `sum` function with a generator expression `(1 for h in hours if h >= target)`. The generator expression generates 1 for each employee who meets or exceeds the target hours, and the `sum` function adds up all the generated 1's, giving us the count of employees who met the target.
