Here is a faster and improved version of the provided Python code:


class Solution:
    def distanceTraveled(self, mainTank: int, additionalTank: int) -> int:
        distance = mainTank * 10 # Calculate the initial distance traveled based on fuel in main tank
        remainingFuel = mainTank # Keep track of remaining fuel in main tank
        
        while remainingFuel >= 5: # As long as there is at least 5 liters of fuel in main tank
            fuelTransfer = min(additionalTank, 5 - remainingFuel) # Calculate the amount of fuel to transfer
            remainingFuel += fuelTransfer # Transfer fuel from additional tank to main tank
            additionalTank -= fuelTransfer
            distance += remainingFuel * 2 # Add the distance traveled with the remaining fuel in main tank
            remainingFuel = 0 # Reset the remaining fuel in main tank to 0
            
        return distance


In this code, I have optimized the fuel transfer process by calculating the amount of fuel to transfer in each iteration instead of always transferring 1 liter. Additionally, I have updated the distance calculation to properly account for the remaining fuel in the main tank after each iteration.
