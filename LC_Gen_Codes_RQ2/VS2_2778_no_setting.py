Certainly! Here's the optimized version of the code:


class Solution:
    def sumOfSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        special_sum = 0
        for num in nums:
            special_sum += num * num
        return special_sum


In this optimized version, we removed the unnecessary calculation of `n` (the length of `nums`) since we can directly iterate over the elements of `nums` using a loop. By iterating directly over the elements, we avoid the need to check for special indices and calculate the square of each element. This results in a faster and more concise code.
