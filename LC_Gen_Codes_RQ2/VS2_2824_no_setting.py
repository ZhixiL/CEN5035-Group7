Here is the optimized version of the `countPairs` function:

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()  # Sort the input array
        n = len(nums)
        count = 0
        left = 0
        right = n - 1

        while left < right:
            if nums[left] + nums[right] < target:  # If the sum is less than the target
                count += right - left  # Increment count by the number of elements between left and right
                left += 1  # Increment left pointer
            else:
                right -= 1  # Decrement right pointer

        return count

This optimized version reduces the time complexity of the function from O(n^2) to O(nlogn) by sorting the array and using two pointers approach. The left pointer starts from the beginning of the array and the right pointer starts from the end. The function compares the sum of the elements at the left and right pointers with the target. If the sum is less than the target, it increments the count by the number of elements between the left and right pointers and moves the left pointer one step forward. If the sum is greater than or equal to the target, it moves the right pointer one step backward. This way, it avoids unnecessary iterations and improves the efficiency of the function.
