Here's an improved and faster version of the code:

class Solution:
    def sumIndicesWithKSetBits(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        sum = 0
        
        for i in range(1 << len(nums)):
            # Count the number of set bits in i
            count = 0
            temp = i
            
            while temp > 0:
                if temp & 1:
                    count += 1
                temp >>= 1
            
            # Check if the count is equal to k
            if count == k:
                sum += nums[i]
        
        return sum

In this version, instead of iterating through the indices of `nums`, we are iterating through all possible numbers from 0 to 2^len(nums) - 1. For each number, we count the number of set bits by performing a bitwise AND operation with 1 to check if the rightmost bit is set, and then right-shifting the number by 1 to move on to the next bit. This process is repeated until the number becomes 0.

By using this approach, we can count the set bits for each number without relying on the `bin` function, which can be slower for larger numbers.

This optimized code should provide a faster solution compared to the original implementation.
