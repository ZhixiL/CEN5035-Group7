Here is a modified version of the code that uses a single loop and avoids repeated iteration over the same range:

class Solution:
    def differenceOfSums(self, n: int, m: int) -> int:
        num1 = 0
        num2 = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % m != 0:
                num1 += i
            else:
                num2 += i
        return num1 - num2

This code should provide the same result but with improved efficiency by avoiding unnecessary iterations.
