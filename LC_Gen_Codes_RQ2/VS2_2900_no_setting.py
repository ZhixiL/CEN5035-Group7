Here is a modified version of the code that should be faster and more efficient:

from typing import List

class Solution:
    def getWordsInLongestSubsequence(self, n: int, words: List[str], groups: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        group_dict = {}
        for i, group in enumerate(groups):
            if group not in group_dict:
                group_dict[group] = []
            group_dict[group].append(words[i])
        
        longest_subsequence = []
        max_length = 0
        
        for group in group_dict:
            if len(group_dict[group]) > max_length:
                longest_subsequence = group_dict[group]
                max_length = len(group_dict[group])
        
        return longest_subsequence

This solution uses a dictionary to group the words based on their corresponding group numbers. Then, it iterates through the groups to find the longest subsequence by comparing the lengths of the subsequence for each group. The longest subsequence and its length are stored in variables, and at the end, the longest subsequence is returned. This implementation should be faster and more efficient than the original code.
