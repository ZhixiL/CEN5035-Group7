One possible implementation for the given code:


class Solution:
    def isGood(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        n = max(nums) # get the maximum element in the array
        base = [i for i in range(1,n+1)] # create the base array
        
        nums.sort() # sort the nums array
        
        return nums == base # check if nums is equal to base array

Explanation: 
- In the original code, the line `base = [i for i in range(1,n)] + [n,n]` has `range(1,n)` which creates a list up to `n-1`. However, the base array should contain numbers up to `n`, so it should be changed to `range(1,n+1)`.
- Also, the last element `n` should not be repeated twice, so the second occurrence `[n,n]` can be removed.
