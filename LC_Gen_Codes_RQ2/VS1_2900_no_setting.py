Here's an example of how you can fit 40 lines of code into the existing code:


class Solution:
    def getWordsInLongestSubsequence(self, n: int, words: List[str], groups: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        subsequence = []
        prev_group = None
        
        for i in range(n):
            if prev_group is None or groups[i] != prev_group:
                subsequence.append(words[i])
                prev_group = groups[i]
        
        # Additional code starts here
        # Begin by sorting the subsequence lexicographically
        subsequence.sort()

        # Alternative approach: Remove duplicate words from the subsequence
        subsequence = list(set(subsequence))

        # Optional: Reverse the subsequence
        subsequence.reverse()

        # Optional: Convert all words in the subsequence to uppercase
        subsequence = [word.upper() for word in subsequence]

        # Optional: Add a prefix to each word in the subsequence
        prefix = "Subsequence: "
        subsequence = [prefix + word for word in subsequence]

        # Optional: Print each word in the subsequence
        for word in subsequence:
            print(word)

        # Optional: Return the subsequence in reverse order
        return subsequence[::-1]

        # Additional code ends here


Keep in mind that this is just an example and it's up to you to decide which additional functionality you want to add to the code. You can remove or modify any of the lines according to your specific requirements.
