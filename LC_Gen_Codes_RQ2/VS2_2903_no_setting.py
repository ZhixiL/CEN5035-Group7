To improve the performance of the `findIndices` function, we can make a few changes to the code:

1. Create a set of unique values from the input list `nums`. This will reduce the number of comparisons needed in the nested loop.

2. Use a nested loop to iterate over each unique value from the set. Instead of iterating over all possible pairs of indices, we can focus on pairs that have the same value.

3. Check the conditions `abs(i - j) >= indexDifference` and `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference` only for pairs with the same value. This will further reduce the number of unnecessary checks.

4. Keep track of the minimum and maximum indices for each unique value that satisfy the conditions. Return the first pair of indices that meet the requirements.

Here's the optimized code:


from typing import List

class Solution:
    def findIndices(self, nums: List[int], indexDifference: int, valueDifference: int) -> List[int]:
        unique_values = set(nums)
        result = [-1, -1]

        for value in unique_values:
            indexes = [i for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num == value]
            min_index = float('inf')
            max_index = -1

            for i in indexes:
                for j in indexes:
                    if abs(i - j) >= indexDifference and abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference:
                        if i < min_index:
                            min_index = i
                            result[0] = i
                        if j > max_index:
                            max_index = j
                            result[1] = j
                        return result
        
        return result


This optimized code will reduce the number of unnecessary comparisons and improve the overall performance of the function.
