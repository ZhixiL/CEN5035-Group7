Here is a slightly optimized version of the code:


class Solution:
    def findKOr(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums_len = len(nums)
        result = 0
        
        for i in range(32):  # considering 32 bits in an integer
            count = 0
            
            for num in nums:
                if count >= k:
                    break
                
                if num & (1 << i) != 0:
                    count += 1
        
            if count >= k:
                result |= (1 << i)
        
        return result


The optimization is as follows:
- Moved the `if count >= k` check inside the inner loop and broke out of it immediately if the count exceeds k. This avoids unnecessarily counting numbers after the required k bits are found.
- Added an additional check after the inner loop to update the `result` even if the outer loop ends without finding k bits. This ensures correctness in the case where there are less than k numbers with kth bit set.
