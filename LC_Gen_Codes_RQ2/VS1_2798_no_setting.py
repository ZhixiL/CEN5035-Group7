Here's a variation of your code that includes 40 lines:


class Solution:
    def numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(self, hours: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for h in hours:
            if h >= target:
                count += 1
            
        return count


def test_numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget():
    s = Solution()
    
    # Test case 1 - No employees meet the target
    hours1 = [6, 7, 5, 8, 4]
    target1 = 9
    assert s.numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours1, target1) == 0
    
    # Test case 2 - All employees meet the target
    hours2 = [9, 10, 10, 9, 9]
    target2 = 9
    assert s.numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours2, target2) == 5
    
    # Test case 3 - Some employees meet the target
    hours3 = [6, 9, 11, 8, 7]
    target3 = 9
    assert s.numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours3, target3) == 3
    
    # Test case 4 - Empty list of hours
    hours4 = []
    target4 = 9
    assert s.numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours4, target4) == 0
    
    # Test case 5 - Target is equal to 0
    hours5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    target5 = 0
    assert s.numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget(hours5, target5) == 5
    
    print("All tests pass.")

test_numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget()


This code adds a test function `test_numberOfEmployeesWhoMetTarget()` that includes 5 different test cases to verify that your solution is working correctly.
