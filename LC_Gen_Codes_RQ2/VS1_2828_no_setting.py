Here are 40 lines of code for the given Python code:


class Solution:
    def isAcronym(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> bool:
        # Step 1: Define an empty string variable to store the acronym
        acronym = ""
        
        # Step 2: Iterate over each word in the list of words
        for word in words:
            # Step 3: Append the first character of each word to the acronym
            acronym += word[0]
        
        # Step 4: Check if the generated acronym matches the given string
        return acronym == s

# Test the function
s = Solution()
words = ["Hello", "World"]
print(s.isAcronym(words, "HW"))  # Output: True
print(s.isAcronym(words, "AW"))  # Output: False


Note: This code assumes that the `List` data type is imported from the `typing` module. If you haven't imported it, you can add `from typing import List` at the beginning of your code.
