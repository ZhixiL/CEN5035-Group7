Here's a fast and efficient way to write the given code:


from typing import List

class Solution:
    def isAcronym(self, words: List[str], s: str) -> bool:
        return ''.join(word[0] for word in words) == s


Explanation:

1. Instead of concatenating each first character of the words using string concatenation, we can use a generator expression inside the `join()` function to join all the first characters directly.
2. By using the `join()` function, it allows us to avoid unnecessary string object creations during concatenation.
3. We can directly return the comparison between the joined acronym and the given string `s`.
