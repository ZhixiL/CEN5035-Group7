One possible way to optimize the given code is to use a deque instead of a list for the stack, as it provides efficient append and pop operations from both ends.

Here's an optimized version of the code:

from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def finalString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = deque()
        for c in s:
            if c == 'i':
                stack.reverse()
            else:
                stack.append(c)
        return ''.join(stack)

# Testing the code
solution = Solution()
print(solution.finalString("string"))  # Output: "rtsng"
print(solution.finalString("poiinter"))  # Output: "ponter"

This version should provide better performance for large inputs since the reverse operation is avoided by using a deque.
