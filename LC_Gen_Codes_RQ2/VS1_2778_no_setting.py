Here is the code with 40 additional lines of comments for clarification:


class Solution:
    def sumOfSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)  # Calculate the length of the input array
        special_sum = 0  # Initialize special_sum variable to store the sum of squared special elements

        # Iterate through all indices from 1 to n
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            # Check if i divides n
            if n % i == 0:
                # Square the special element and add it to special_sum
                special_sum += nums[i-1] * nums[i-1]

        # Return the sum of squared special elements
        return special_sum
